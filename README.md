Abstract
Nowadays the final score of the first innings of any cricket match is predictedusing CRR (Current Run Rate) method. The number of average runs scored inan over is multiplied by the total number of overs to get the final score. Thesekinds of systems are not useful when the T20 matches are considered becausein T20 cricket the match can change its state very quickly irrespective ofcurrent run rate. The match can change within 1 or 2 overs. So, to get anaccurate score prediction we should have a system that can predict the firstinnings score more effectively.
