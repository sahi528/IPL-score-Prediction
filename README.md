## Abstract

Traditional methods like the Current Run Rate (CRR) are inadequate for predicting first-innings scores in T20 cricket, where game dynamics can change rapidly. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to accurately predict scores, integrating factors such as historical data, live match statistics, weather, pitch conditions, and player performance.
